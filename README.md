# React-fundamental-projects

I developed these projects to gain experience and improve my skills in frontend development using ReactJS. While developing these projects, I have benefited a lot from [John Smilga](https://github.com/john-smilga), thank you again.

There are many things I learned through these projects ðŸš„ 
Some of which are;

- useState
- useEffect and Conditional Rendering
- Forms
- useRef
- useContext
- use Reducer
- React Router
- useCallback
